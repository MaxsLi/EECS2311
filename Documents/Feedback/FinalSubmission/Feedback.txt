- After adding circle, the button should change to be unclickable or to revert the adding of the circle
- When adding a circle, pressing undo and then trying to add the circle again, the app does not add the circle. Only if You click undo. 
- Animations are very nice and the GUI is pretty intuitive without having to read the user manual
- On startup, having something more descriptive than just the button with show would be more helpful to the user. 
- The appearance menu might be made easier to navigate by having a separate window in which to edit the app 
- The layout is very visually appealing and simple, which is good.
- There is no way to get back to the main menu from the app
- Saving and loading works well
- The adding and deleting of entries in the nav bar is very useful along with the list of entries.
- Overall, the app is well made and has very few bugs
